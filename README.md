## Modern Database Systems Course

Welcome to the Modern Database Systems course! In this comprehensive program, we delved into the fascinating realm of NoSQL databases and explored various models, providing a thorough understanding of their functionalities. Our exploration covered key concepts such as key-value pairs, document databases, column databases, graph databases, as well as distributed computing frameworks including Hadoop and Spark.

### Course Highlights:

1. **Diverse NoSQL Models:**
   - *Key-Value Pair:* Understanding the fundamental concept of storing data as key-value pairs.
   - *Document Database:* Exploring the flexibility of document-oriented databases in handling semi-structured data.
   - *Column Database:* Analyzing the advantages of columnar storage for efficient querying and retrieval.
   - *Graph Database: Unraveling the intricacies of graph databases for effective representation of relationships in data.

2. **Distributed Computing Frameworks:**
   - *Hadoop:* An in-depth study of Hadoop, a powerful framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets.
   - *Spark:* Exploring the capabilities of Spark for high-speed data processing in a distributed computing environment.

### Hands-On Projects:

The course included immersive hands-on projects, offering practical experience in working with a variety of NoSQL databases and distributed computing tools.

1. **Cassandra:**
   - *Objective:* Implementing and understanding the functionalities of a distributed NoSQL database like Cassandra.

2. **MapReduce:**
   - *Objective:* Leveraging the MapReduce paradigm for efficient processing of large-scale data.

3. **MySpark:**
   - *Objective:* Hands-on experience with Apache Spark, a fast and general-purpose distributed computing system.

4. **Redis:**
   - *Objective:* Exploring the capabilities of Redis, an in-memory data structure store, in real-world applications.

5. **Riak:**
   - *Objective:* Understanding the distributed nature of Riak and its applications in fault-tolerant, scalable systems.

6. **MongoDB:**
   - *Objective:* Designing and implementing solutions using MongoDB, a widely-used document-oriented database.
